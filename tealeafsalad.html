    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Laphet Thoke or Tea Leaf Salad is not only the most famous and adored of all Burmese salads, it holds a
        significant cultural importance. Highly regarded as the king of all leaves, laphet is a perfect appetizer,
        snack, dessert, palate cleanser, stimulant and can even become a full course meal with just a bowl of hot
        steamed rice. Laphet serves as a centerpiece for all events, from peace-making and sealing the deals to asking
        for the bride's hand and the list goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
        Juvenile tea leaves, usually two leaves and a bud, are hand picked and fermented over two weeks. At the end of
        natural fermentation, they are flavored with salt, lime juice, garlic, green chilies and submerged in fragrant
        peanut oil. Because laphet is predominantly delicate, crunchy-toasty bites of peanuts, sesame seeds and garlic
        chips are a must, for contrast of textures. The brines of fish sauce and dried shrimps temper the slightly
        bitter tea leaves interlocked with loud punches from chilies, garlic and lime juice while a thatch of shredded
        cabbage, tomatoes and sweet corn enlivens every layer of the salad. This salad is unique because of the bold
        flavors of tea leaves but it is addicting because each component enhance, highlight and respect the uniqueness
        of laphet. Though there's no strict restriction to be part of the laphet team but careful not to overpower the
        team captain.

        No matter when or why you opt for laphet, each strand of these pickled leaves will slowly excite our palates and
        ignite the happy stations in our brain till we all joyously ascend to laphet heaven.
