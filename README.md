# odin-recipes

**Project Title**
Project: Recipes

**Description**
It's time to practice all of HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished, unless you're into brutalist web design.

But it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

**Installation Instructions**
1. Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it odin-recipes and choose the public option instead of the default private.
2. Clone that repository onto my local machine, inside the repos folder that I previously created in the Git Basics lesson. The command is look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes. git (I use SSH).
3. Now cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on my local machine.
4. Set up my README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed it. (I can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what I have learned.)
