**Project Title**
Project: Recipes

**Description**
It's time to practice all of HTML knowledge I have acquired. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished, unless I'm into brutalist web design.

But it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

**Features**
* Homepage with Recipe Previews:
The homepage displays a collection of recipe previews, each with image, a brief description and some links to other recipes pages.

* Individual Recipe Pages:
Each recipe has its own page, including images, description, ingredients and steps.

* Responsive Design:
Currently not available yet.

* Navigation Menu:
A simple navigation menu is available on all pages, allowing users to easily switch between recipes and homepage.

* Consistent Styling:
The website uses default font styles and sizes (according to browser you use). I will update after learning css.

* Clean and Structured Code:
The HTML and CSS codes are well-organized and easy to read, following best practices for web development.

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository onto your local machine, inside the repos folder that you previously created in the GIt Basics lesson. The command should look like git clone git@github.com:username/odin-recipes.git (use SSH).
2. cd into the odin-recipes project directory that is now on your local machine.

**Usage**
Simple clock on the recipe names on the homepage to view the details.
