    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you are also trying to recover from those lavish feasts during your holiday splurge, this light and tangy egg
        curry has all the right answers! It comforts you, warms you from within, makes you worry less about
        overindulging and feeds you with nostalgic feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tenderly laced with onions, tomatoes, paprika, turmeric powder and curry spices, the tang of this light and mild
        curry comes from the tamarind pulp, liberally used to compliment the richness of the eggs and offset the heat.
        It is more common in Burma to pick duck eggs over chicken eggs for curries as they are firmer and easier to cook
        and contain a bigger, fattier yolk. Also, dried salted fish is added to flavor and give more body to the curry.
        This makes the role of the tamarind more significant as their acidic juices calm the brines of dried fish while
        wrapping all the flavors up with a fruity note.
